# Deep Research Agent – AI Agent Assignment Submission

This repository documents my submission for the MNC company's AI Agent selection process. It features a professional-grade Deep Research Agent built using a 4-layer architecture model inspired by prompt engineering frameworks.

## Project Overview

**Title:** Deep Research Agent – Automating Web-Based Academic and Analytical Research  
**Author:** Alfas E  
**Type:** AI Agent Simulation  
**Tools Used:** ChatGPT (Prompt Engineering), Markdown  
**Status:** Assignment Submission (Non-functional prototype)

---

## Use Case

This AI Agent automates time-intensive research tasks by:
- Understanding complex user queries
- Decomposing them into manageable subtopics
- Retrieving simulated search results from credible sources
- Summarizing and structuring the findings

### Example Query
> “Impact of quantum computing on AI”

The agent responds with subtopic summaries, source references, and a final structured outline.

## Architecture Design – 4 Layers

| Layer            | Purpose                                                |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Input Understanding** | Understand and classify user input as a research query |
| **State Tracker**       | Maintain memory of completed topics and sources       |
| **Task Planner**        | Simulate search, extract, summarize, and cite         |
| **Output Generator**    | Present structured, markdown-ready research briefs    |

##  Reflections

This project was a simulation of what a real AI research assistant might do. I focused on clarity, prompt engineering, and documentation — treating ChatGPT as a teammate rather than just a tool.
